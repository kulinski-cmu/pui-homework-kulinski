# **FP2 \- Evaluation of the Final project**

## Project Description

This project is a cross stitch pattern maker. This will allow crafters to make their own patterns and base patterns off of pictures. The main motivation for this project is that there is not currently a strong platform to allow people to make their own projects. Crafters want to make things that speak to them, which includes the process of pattern making.

## High-Fi Prototypes

### *Prototype 1*

![title for prototype1](images/prototype1.png)

A brief description and summary of the user feedback (\<100 words, 2 images) 

### *Prototype 2*

…

## Usability Test

Discuss the user feedback you got during the evaluation / usability test (\~300 words). Indicate which feedback you implemented, inspired new directions, or otherwise influenced your final design. 

## Updated Designs

Show screenshots of your updated design based on the user feedback (\<100 words, \~2 images).

## Feedback Summary

Summarize the feedback you received in the lab session and discuss how it influenced your design (\~300 words). 
One piece of feedback I recieved was to better distinguish the buttons on the design. This includes both distinguishing what page you are on through the buttons and differetiating the different types of buttons. Even though the buttons all do different things, in my updated design, they all look mostly the same. This feedback will infulence my design since I will change some of the components to better communicate inforamtion to the user. Previously, I was focusing mostly on the aesthic of the website, which wouldn't be useful to the user if they couldn't understand where they are within the page.

A second piece of feedback that I recieved is adding a back or undo button as part of the pattern design page. This would allow users to undo actions and go back to the previous pattern. This will influence my design because it will help users to better recover from choices and how they interact with their project. I will put this into my design and I will also spend time considering using a eraser method as well.

## Generative AI Use Plan

I do not currently plan to use AI in my implementation. In order to fully understand how my code works and gain the most information from this class, I believe that working on the code entirely on my own is valuable. This includes all portions of the project, including testing. The best way to learn how to do something is to actually do it, not try and figure out how an AI system completed it. While I understand that this method and mindset my hold me back, I do not believe that I am in a place to utilize AI well within the scope of my project. 

If I decide to use generative AI, it will be with writing the content of the learn pages as that is not the main focus of the project. Using the information that generative AI provides to assist with making text seems more reasonable than using generative AI to aid in writing code. 

### *Tool Use*

* ChatGPT  
  * I might use it for helping to writing instructions on how to cross stitch and read patterns because it can help me use language that a novice can understand. It could help me to restate sections or prhase thoughts in a way more accessible to people.
  * I will not use it for coding because it might not be able to help me with actually understanding how to do the work. ChatGPT does not cite its work or thought process, so it can be difficult to understand how the code works or why it would suggest it. You need to be extremely careful when using code from generative AI and I believe I will gain more from writing the code myself.   

### *Responsible Use*

If I choose to use generative AI, I will cite it in any place that I use it. The use of generative AI should be cited the same as any other information that you referecence in your work. In addition, I will check the validity of the information that it provides. I will not just copy and paste outputs into my work without understanding what was given and being able to explain that information.

# **FP1 \- Proposal for Critique**

## Idea Sketches

### *Idea 1: Museum Website*

![3 screens for the museum website. Displayed from top to bottom: a welcome page that will hold general information about the website and how it works; what an exhibit will look like; the navigation menu meant to look like a museum map.](musuem-website.JPG)

The basic idea is to be able to experience the feeling of exploring a museum from a website. The website would function by letting the user explore a museum space and look at different exhibits. 

The interaction would happen when people are exploring the space and being able to find out more information about the exhibits by clicking on them. Additionally, I am interested in implementing a “guide” that would be able to tell the information to you. I imagine this guide functioning similarly to old sci-fi robots. I would need to find and use a text to speech library for this aspect of the project. 

One way I plan on making the design accessible is through the use of the guide. I would have it read out the same information that would be presented to the user via text. In this sense, I am using the guide as a proxy for a screen reader, but the functionality is built into the website. I think this would allow the users to feel more comfortable with the website and I hope that people might benefit from something similar to the curb cut effect. The second way I plan on making the design accessible is to make the navigation system simple, but seem complex through the design of the interface. I want it to function like clicking on links so that those using assistive technology have an easier time navigating, but seem more complex.

I want this website to display dinosaur information, such as specific information about different fossils, how fossils form, and the different eras of the earth. I want this website to be generally informational for those who don’t know much about dinosaurs to those who know a moderate amount of information. This would not be a website designed for experts.


### *Idea 2: Cross Stitch Pattern Maker*

![3 screens for the cross stitch website. Displayed from top to bottom: the main screen with a grid that allows you to edit the pattern and a box with all the colors picked for that project; the screen for adding new colors to a project; display that allows users to chose, edit, and look at past designs.](cross-stich-website.JPG)

The idea of this website is to allow users to design cross stitch patterns. This will include seeing all of the DMC, a specific embroidery thread maker, colors and having a place to edit their designs. 

The main interaction would be placing stitches in the work space, which is the grid seen in the first screen. Users would be able to place a stitch per box. The second interaction will be choosing colors, and users will be able to look up a color by number, color group, or name, which is how DMC allows for searching on their website as well. 

One way I plan on making the design accessible is by using coding techniques that would allow the user to interact with the grid even if they were not able to click on it directly. This would mean that the user could use non-traditional input devices and still make patterns. I also want to make the searching process as intuitive as possible. That’s why I plan to allow users to search in multiple ways. I also want to include an undo button, which will allow users to recover from mistakes easier than if they had to recolor squares individually.

I want this website to display information about the pattern that people are making. When designing a project, it’s important to see how the different colors will look together and how the design looks overall. This information can be difficult to convey depending on how you try to display the grid.

### *Idea 3: Personal Website*

![3 screens for the personal website. Displayed from top to bottom: a main page that describes who I am; a page that displays information about what work I did during my udergraduate experinces; a page that displays information about what work I did during my graduate experiences.](person-website.JPG)

The idea of this website is to convey information about the things that I have done and completed.

The main interaction of this website would be learning about the different projects and exploring the website. The website would be divided into work I did during undergraduate school and work I did during graduate school. Clicking on the different projects would display different information and different images. 

One way that I plan on making this website accessible is to not overuse animations. While animations are interesting, using too many of them may make it harder for people to read or interact with the website. I also plan to follow good practices that allow for screen readers to easily understand what is being displayed.

I want this website to display information about me. This website should communicate the things that I have done and completed in a professional manner. It should also display the skills that I have and how I’ve applied them to my work. I also want this website to display some aspect of my personality, not just information about me.

## Feedback Summary

For the museum website, the feedback centered around the ideas of how navigation would or could work. Since the user would be looking around the space in a way that doesn’t seem linear, it may be more difficult to explain how to use the website and may not be intuitive. One idea that was discussed was helping with wayfinding by using a minimap. Another that was brought up was basing the navigation off how old dungeon crawling games handled navigation: only allow the players to move in the four cardinal directions. In addition, it could be useful to include symbols that point to the directions that the user would be able to travel.

For the cross stitch pattern website, the main critique was on the complexity of the site. Since the website really has 2 main functions, creating and storing projects, it was unclear if it would be complex enough for it to work for the project. One idea that was shared to increase complexity was to allow users to import images and put them behind the grid to follow an existing photo or pattern. Another suggestion was to add a sharing feature that allowed users to see other’s patterns and receive feedback on their own. This would foster collaboration, something that is important to people in crafts. Another thing that was mentioned was that this website had a clear audience and seemed like something that I was personally interested in.

For the personal website, the main critique was that it may not make sense to make this due to the scope of the project. Since most of the choices that would be made would not be interactions with the site, but rather how the information is laid out. While this is an important aspect of interaction, it may not be the intention of this project to focus on it. Being able to lay out a website doesn’t really demonstrate my abilities with coding and creating a usable website. Additionally, it was mentioned that it would be useful to have a project to add to my portfolio, not just to have a portfolio. 
 
## Feedback Digestion

For the museum website, I will definitely incorporate more thought into how the user will navigate the website. I like the idea of borrowing design language from old dungeon video games because video games were important to me growing up. Being able to incorporate something that is reminiscent and nostalgic might give the website a stronger identity, which is something that I definitely want with this project. I’m not sure if I will include symbols that help users understand the directions that they can travel because I don’t want to overwhelm the user with the amount of information that they are presented at any given time. I may try a version with and without the symbols to better understand how it might look and feel.

For the cross stitch pattern website, I would definitely like to include the idea of letting people put images over or under the grid. Part of my inspiration for this website is that there doesn’t seem to be any good websites that allow me to make my patterns. I would appreciate the ability to overlay images, so I believe that other crafters would be interested in it as well. I do not think I will include a social aspect because I am not interested in trying to make a website that allows users to share information between each other and I don’t want to try to handle moderation that needs to occur when sharing work. If the scope of the project was different, I might be more interested in this idea.

For the personal website, the main critiques had to do with the scope of the project in relation to the project definition. Based on this, if I choose to implement this, I may not continue with trying to iterate with this idea. If it is a mismatch for this project, it might make sense to think of a different project or focus on the other ideas.
